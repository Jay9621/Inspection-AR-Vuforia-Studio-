# Inspection AR

Inspection AR is a project built using **Vuforia Studio** and **ThingWorx** to create an augmented reality (AR) solution for inspection processes. This project demonstrates how AR can streamline inspection workflows by providing real-time data input, image capture, and integration with ThingWorx.

## Features
- Input inspection details through an interactive AR interface.
- Capture images using a device camera and store them with inspection data.
- Save inspection data to **ThingWorx** Data Tables for analysis and reporting.
- Visualize real-time inspection data in ThingWorx Mashups.
- Clear and reset inspection carts with a single click.

## Technologies Used
- **Vuforia Studio** for creating AR experiences.
- **ThingWorx** for data storage and backend integration.
- **AngularJS** for dynamic front-end logic.
- **Ionic Framework** for enhanced UI interactions.
